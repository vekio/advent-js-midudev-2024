# Santa Claus ðŸŽ… is checking his workshop inventory to prepare gift delivery. The elves have recorded the toys in an array of objects, but the information is a bit disorganized. You need to help Santa organize the inventory.

# You will receive an array of objects, where each object represents a toy and has the properties:

# name: the name of the toy (string).
# quantity: the available quantity of that toy (integer).
# category: the category to which the toy belongs (string).
# Write a function that processes this array and returns an object that organizes the toys as follows:

# The keys of the object will be the categories of toys.
# The values will be objects that have the toy names as keys and the total quantities of each toy in that category as values.
# If there are toys with the same name in the same category, you must sum their quantities.
# If the array is empty, the function should return an empty object {}.

    {"name": "doll", "quantity": 25, "category": "toys"},
    {"name": "doll", "quantity": 25, "category": "toys"},
